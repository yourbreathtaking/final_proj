## [leaflet-compare 1.0.1] - 2021-02-01

### Changed

- Republish to overcome npm's unpublish policy. Version 1.0.0 had the fork's links
  in package.json, some files where not ignored in .npmignore and the release date was
  still tba.

## [leaflet-compare 1.0.0] - 2021-02-01

### Added

- New option `position` for setting the sliders initial position.
- `setPosition` is no longer a noop and serves the purpose of setting the range sliders position.

### Changed

- Use webpack-dev-server instead of budo
- Use ESLint instead of standard
- Use jest for testing
- `leaflet` is now a peerDependency since it is assumed that the user already has leaflet installed himself.

### Fixed

- Use `L.Evented` instead of deprecated `L.Mixin.Events`

### Security

- Updated all devDependencies to their latest versions
- Removed vulnerable (and unused) dependencies from the original leaflet-side-by-side
  plugin.
